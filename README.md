# TKinterDash
Minimalist dash/gauge display) that displays data from your OBD reader (right now using Python-OBD, plan to tweak for external data later)

Currently only setup to display on an RPi 7" display, this will be changed too!

Still extremely WIP!!!

## Features (WIP)
- WIP configuration app/panel for tweaking all settings
- RPM bar with 3 configurable zones (Warn, alert, and alarm)
- Coolant temp bar and value readout (currently only in C, will add F)
- Throttle position display
- Speed display that can be swapped between MPH and KPH
- Gear display (calculated from ratios, needs tweaking to work with other cars)
- Shift suggestions (I called it SmartShift, its extremely annoying, ill make it optional)

## Example screenshot (does not contain all features)
